<p>In visualizing data, we use graphics to gain and communicate an honest understanding of data in context.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-motivation-imagine-first" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation: Imagine First!</h2>
<p>Figures are a crucial tool for exploring your data <em>and</em> communicating what you learn from the data.</p>
<p>Whether you are doing a quick check to assess basic features of a dataset or creating a key figure for an important presentation, the best practice is to work thoughtfully.</p>
<div id="section-the-i.c.e.e.-method" class="section level3">
<h3>The <strong>I.C.E.E. method</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I</strong><em>magine</em> how you want your graph to look, <em>before</em> you</li>
<li><strong>C</strong><em>ode</em>. Once you have the basic starting point,</li>
<li><strong>E</strong><em>valuate</em> your work, and</li>
<li><strong>E</strong><em>laborate</em> (refine it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat until the figure is as awesome as it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>Our DCM course does not require students to learn code to produce figures independently (although of course, you can if you want!). However, you WILL try to learn to think like a data analyst and figure designer, and will critique graphics produced by others often, so this process is still valuable to keep in mind.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="section-no-to-mindless-copypaste" class="section level3">
<h3>NO To Mindless Copy/Paste</h3>
<p>Too many of us fall into the trap of starting to write code (or copy/pasting it!) <em>before</em> pausing to think carefully about the desired outcome, then settling for the first vaguely relevant result (or <a href="https://twitter.com/accidental__art?lang=en">delighting in the unintended outcome</a>…).</p>
<p>If using someone else’s code, as you often will in this course, the equivalent is just running the code you are given without even looking at it, and accepting the results without critique.</p>
<p>You can do better! You <em>will</em> do better. This tutorial provides some advice to get you started. It can also provide inspiration for constructive critique of others’ graphics.</p>
<p>Here we focus only on the <strong>I_EE</strong> parts of the process, where you design and assess graphics. Code will (maybe) come later, in another optional tutorial.</p>
<p>Specifically, how <em>exactly</em> should a graphic look? There are so many choices: color, size, text and more. What are best practices for creating something beautiful, that represents the data honestly, and is easy to understand?</p>
<p>This tutorial will provide some rules of thumb to help you <strong>Evaluate</strong> statistical graphics. It will also teach you to spot common problems and suggest ways to fix them, allowing you to provide constructive critique (to yourself or to others!) about how to <strong>Elaborate</strong> and refine data visualizations.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-you-still-have-your-freedom" class="section level3">
<h3>You still have your freedom!</h3>
<p>As you digest all these rules and tips, you may wonder: “Do I <em>have</em> to always obey every one?” Well…No, of course not. Be creative!</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s OK to break these rules <em>when you have thought it through</em> and <em>with a good justification</em>. A good justification means that in your particular case, breaking a certain rule will make your graph more informative, easier to understand, or better at telling the story you’re highlighting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-learning-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>This tutorial will give you some basic tools to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Graph data with integrity</strong>, avoiding misleading design choices</li>
<li><strong>Tell the right story</strong>, including elements that <em>emphasize your main finding</em> and make your figure <em>easy to interpret at a glance</em></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-bye-junk" class="section level2">
<h2>Bye, Junk!</h2>
<p>Our first principle is: if it doesn’t <em>need</em> to be in your graph, it shouldn’t be there. Keep things as simple as possible. What are some justifications for a <em>need</em> to include an element in a plot?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is crucial to the story you are telling, or the question you are answering.</li>
<li>It emphasizes your main point. For example, some plots may not need color, and in others it may add crucial visual contrast to highlight a main point.</li>
<li>It makes the graph easier to read and understand</li>
<li>It makes the main message of the graph more memorable</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need it, include it, but if not, keep it simple!</p>
<p>Imagine you are using <em>very</em> expensive ink to print every element of the graph. Is every drop of in you’re using really worth it? If not, take it out. As influential data visualization thinker Edward Tufte put it in <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi"><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data change. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, don’t let annotations, labels, grids, etc. overwhelm the visual impact of your data:</p>

<div id="section-proportional-ink-and-axis-scales" class="section level2">
<h2>Proportional Ink and Axis Scales</h2>
<p>For bar graphs and other filled-area plots, the <strong>area</strong> of a graphic element should correspond to the proportion of the data it represents.</p>
<p>This principle might be violated if the lower limit of a count/frequency axis is not 0. If you’re showing the number or proportion or percentage of observations in categories, it’s usually best to set the lower limit of the axis to 0.</p>
<p>If you don’t start at 0, make sure the “at a glance” interpretation of your figure is not misleading!</p>
<p>A similar principle applies for plots of quantitative variables <em>if they use filled areas to represent numeric values</em> and <em>there is some value (zero or another threshold value) that is an important reference point.</em></p>
<p>For optional additional detail on choosing honest axis limits and more examples, check out the blog post by the excellent but (sorry) profanely named <a href="https://www.callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html">Calling B*** project</a>.</p>

<div id="section-grids-and-boxes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grids and Boxes</h2>
<p>Should your graphics include boxes, axis lines, and grid lines?</p>
<p>Well, it depends…</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing unnecessary axes, grids, and labels yields a cleaner plot that may be easier to take in at a glance – there is less to distract from the main story</li>
<li><strong>But…</strong> omitting needed baselines, tick marks, gridlines, and labels can cause confusion and make it hard to identify categories or estimate numeric values</li>
<li>Scientific graphics usually need axis lines, with tick marks</li>
<li>If a viewer will need to refer to an axis to estimate heights of bars or locations of points, then consider using gridlines for that axis.</li>
<li>Instead of an entire grid, it may be more effective to include single lines indicating important threshold values</li>
<li>Consider using a color that nearly blends into the background for grid lines, so that they detract as little attention as possible from the data</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/07/gridlines-are-gratuitous">Storytelling with Data</a> provide an example of a cluttered figure where the trend over time pops out more as unnecessary grids and boxes are made less visible, then removed:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-text-elements-titles-labels-size" class="section level2">
<h2>Text Elements: Titles, Labels, Size</h2>
<p>When using text in a figure, ensure it is easy to read. Make sure no unneccessary text is included.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default size of text in figures produced by statistical software <em>is almost always too small</em>. Make sure your text is <em>big enough to be easily legible in the context where you will present it</em> (on the page in a report, on a slide for a presentation, etc.)</li>
<li>Other than the title of the vertical (y) axis, all the text in a plot should be horizontal. This makes it easier to read.</li>
<li>Axis labels should be self-explanatory
<ul>
<li>Viewers should be able to guess what they mean accurately without looking at anything but the figure</li>
<li>Use words instead of numeric codes or cryptic abbreviations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Axis labels should also be as short as possible while remaining easy to understand</li>
<li>Every plot should have a title. Sometimes this might be a literal title at the top of the graph, but those are relatively rare. More often in scientific work, a text caption appears below the figure. The first phrase/sentence of the caption acts as the figure’s title</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the melanoma rates over time figure from the last section?</p>

<div id="section-using-color" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Color</h2>
<p>Color - used sparingly - can be an incredibly effective part of a data visualization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your color choices highlight the story you want to tell
<ul>
<li>Consider using black and grey to help some elements fade into the background - for example, grid lines and labels that must be present but aren’t the most important elements</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose color combinations that look good and are distinguishable by color-blind viewers and in greyscale
<ul>
<li>Default to using pre-defined color palettes provided by your software rather than choosing colors manually</li>
<li>Consider being redundant - use size and/or shape as well as color to indicate groups.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use color consistently. Example: if “young” cases are red in one graph, don’t use red for “old” in the next graph</li>
</ul>
<p>The video below, from Storytelling with Data, gives explanations and examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have time, watch from 11:48 to 28:41 (about 17 minutes). This segment will play automatically in the clip below.</li>

<h2>When Things Overlap</h2>
<p>Especially when graphing variables with long category values, you may end up with ugly, illegible overlapping labels. Two easy solutions, in order of preference, are to switch x and y coordinates so the “long” labels are on the y axis (in R, this resizes the plot area so that labels fit); or, to rotate the too-long labels, which eliminates the overlap but makes them harder to read than horizontal text.</p>
<p>Sometimes a title or axis label is too long and runs off the edge of the figure. Using a smaller font is <em>not</em> often an ideal solution. If you can’t just use a shorter label, consider adding line breaks.</p>
