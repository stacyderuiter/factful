## Motivation: Realize the Dream!
Figures are a crucial tool for exploring your data *and* communicating what you learn from the data.

Whether you are doing a quick check to assess basic features of a dataset or creating a key figure for an important presentation, the best practice is to work thoughtfully. You already learned about creating graphics by I.C.E.E:

### The **I.C.E.E. method**: 

- **I***magine* how you want your graph to look, *before* you 
- **C***ode*. Once you have the basic starting point, 
- **E***valuate* your work, and
- **E***laborate* (refine it).

Repeat until the figure is as awesome as it needs to be.

**What's the missing piece that we left for last? That's right: the code. Not most important, but crucial.**

## Learning Objectives

This tutorial will give you tools to:

1. **Create an appropriate visualization** for the *data you have* and the *question you are trying to answer*.
2. **Graph data with integrity**, avoiding misleading design choices
3. **Tell the right story**, including elements that *emphasize your main finding* and make your figure *easy to interpret at a glance*

But specifically, you will now focus on **implementation** -- you have a plan in mind; now how can you **do** it in R?

This tutorial provides a set of code examples and practice exercises, but *leaves out* the details of design already covered in previous tutorials. Here, the assumption is you know what you want, and just need the technique to create it.  

**You are welcome to treat this tutorial like a reference manual: it's more important that you know how to look stuff up here than that you spend lots of time on** *every* **topic, and you don't need to memorize. Complete the first 4 sections if you are new to ggformula, and then refer to the others as needed and as time allows. Get used to using this site as a "manual" to look stuff up on demand.**

(*Sorry about the long table of contents - I don't have a way to nest two list levels to shorten it, but still make it easy to look up specific plot types!*)

## ggformula strategy

### Two important questions

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

To get R (or any software) to create the above plot (or do anything else, really), there are two important questions you must be able to answer.  Before
continuing, see if you can figure out what they are.

### The Questions

To get R (or any software) to create the plot, there are two
important questions you must be able to answer:
  
#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?
  
#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?
  
### Answers to the questions
  
To make the scatter plot you saw before, the answers to our questions are 

#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?

**A.** Make a scatter plot (i.e., a **plot** consisting of **points**)

#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?

**A.** The data used for the plot:
  
 * The variable to be plotted along the $y$ axis.
 * The variable to be plotted along the $x$ axis.
 * The data set that contains the variables.

We just need to learn how to tell R these answers.     

## Graphics with Formulas

### The Formula Template

We will provide answers to our two questions by filling in
the boxes of this important template:
  
  
  <center>
  <h2><strong><span class="invboxed">goal</span> ( <span class="invboxed">yyy</span> ~ <span class="invboxed">xxx</span> , data = <span class="invboxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
  </h2></center>
  
  &nbsp;

We just need to identify which portions of our answers go into which boxes.

### The Name of the Game

It is useful to provide names for the boxes:
  
  <center>
  <h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
  </h2></center>
  &nbsp;

These names can help us remember which things go where.
(The `...` indicates that there are some additional input arguments we will add
  eventually.)

#### Other versions

Sometimes we will add or subtract a bit from our formula.
Here are some other forms we will eventually see.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# simpler version
goal( ~ x, data = mydata )          
# fancier version
goal( y ~ x | z , data = mydata )   
# unified version
goal( formula , data = mydata )     
```

### 2 Questions and the Formula Template


&nbsp;
<center>
  <h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
  </h2></center>
  
  &nbsp;


#### Q. What do you want R to do?  A. goal

* Your answer to this question determines the **function** to use.
* For a plot, the function will describe what sorts of marks to draw (points, in our example).


#### Q. What must R know to do that?  A. arguments 

* Your answer to this question determines the inputs to the function.
* For a plot, we must identify the variables and the data frame that contains them.

### Assembling the pieces

#### Template

&nbsp;
<center>
  <h2><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
  </h2></center>
  
  &nbsp;

#### Pieces

<table align = "center" >
  <tr>
  <th> box </th>
  <th> fill in with </th>
  <th> purpose </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> `goal` </td>
  <td> `gf_point` </td>
  <td> plot some points </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> `y` </td>
  <td> `births` </td>
  <td> y-axis variable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> `x` </td>
  <td> `date` </td>
  <td> x-axis variable </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> `mydata` </td>
  <td> `Births1978`</td>
  <td> name of data set </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
#### Your Turn
  
Put each piece in its place in the template below and then run the code
to create the plot.

```{r, gf_point, exercise = TRUE}
goal(y ~ x, data = mydata)
```

<div id="gf_point-hint">
  If you get an "object not found" or "could not find function" error message,
that indicates that you have not correctly filled in one of the four boxes from
the template.  

Note: R is case sensitive, so watch your capitalization.
</div>
  
  For reference, here are the first three rows of `Births1978`.

```{r}
Births1978 %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  select(births, date, day_of_year)
```

### Using formulas to describe plots

#### The tilde (wiggle)

The most distinctive feature of `ggformula` plots is the use of formulas to 
describe the positional information of a plot.
Formulas in R always involve the tilde character, which is easy to overlook.
It looks like this:  
  
&nbsp;
<center>
  <h2><strong> <span class="boxed">&nbsp;~&nbsp;</span> </strong> 
  </h2></center>
  
  &nbsp;

Make sure you know where the tilde is located on your computer's keyboard! It is often near the upper left-hand corner on American keyboards.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://sldr.netlify.app/data/keyboard-tilde.png")
```

  
#### Formula shapes
  
  Most `gf_` functions take a formula that describes the positional
attributes of the plot.  Using one of these functions with no arguments
will show you the "shape" of the formula it requires.

#### Getting help on formula shapes

Run this code to see the formula shape for `gf_point()`.

```{r, gf-shape, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point()
```

You should see that `gf_point()`'s formula has the shape `y ~ x`, 
so the y-variable name goes before the tilde and the x-variable name goes
after.  (Think:  "y depends on x".  Also note that the y-axis label appears
farther left than the x-axis label.)

#### Order matters in formulas!

Reverse the roles of the variables, changing `births ~ date` to 
`date ~ births`. How does the plot change?

```{r, gf_point-xy, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

### Spaces

### Size Matters

```{r keyboard-quiz}
quiz(
question(
"What is the largest key on your keyboard?",
answer("return/enter"),
answer("caps lock"),
answer("delete"),
answer("the arrow keys"),
answer("space bar", correct = TRUE)
)
)
```


There is a reason that key is biggest -- you should use it **a lot!**.

### R, People, and Spaces

R is not very picky about spaces.  

  * Any number of spaces is equivalent to a single space.
  * Sometimes (but not always) spaces are optional.

My advice is to use spaces liberally. Even if R doesn't care, it makes your code easier for people to read.

  * Always put a space around things like `+`, `*`, `~` etc. (This is a place
  where R doesn't care whether you have a space or not, but I recommend you do.)
  
  * Always put a space after each comma
  
  * Never put a space between a function name and its parentheses (write `head(data)` not `head (data)`)
  
  * Use spaces and line breaks to make your code easy to read.

Mimic the examples you see in this tutorial.

## Data Used

Several datasets will be used in this tutorial.

- The `Births1978` dataset contains information about the number of babies born in the U.S.A. on each day of the year 1978
- The `university_teachers` dataset gives the proportion of university instructors who held different job titles (for example, Tenured Professor or Part-time Instructor), for a selection of years.
- The `NHANES` dataset contains measurements from 10,000 human subjects in
the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.  To learn more about the data,
try one or more of these (Shown for `NHANES`, but can do for any dataset):

  * `?NHANES` (only for NHANES and other built-in R datasets)
  * `names(NHANES)`
  * `glimpse(NHANES)`
  * `inspect(NHANES)`

```{r, NHANES, exercise = TRUE}
?NHANES
```

## Plotting Functions

There are many `gf_...` functions in the `ggfomula` package that create different types of plots. There are also helper functions that can customize axis labels, make multi-panel plots, and more. 

Just to get an idea of what is included in the ggformula
package, run the code below to get a list of all the `gf_` functions that exist
(not *all* are covered here):

```{r, gf_list, exercise=TRUE}
# list all functions starting gf_
apropos("gf_")
```

The following sections give examples of how to use many of the `gf_` functions to create graphics.

## Histograms

- Histograms require a formula with only one variable in it:  `~ x`.  (Notice that `x` goes on 
  the right side.) 
- You can change the size of the bins using either `bins` (the number of bins)
or `binwidth` (the width of the bins).  Experiment with different bins, trying to find balance between too many and too few.  (If you
don't provide `bins` or `binwidth` information, R will just make something up.
You can usually do better if you take control.)
- To get density instead of counts on the y-axis, switch from function
`gf_histogram()` to `gf_dhistogram()`.


Try out the code below, and adjust the number of bins to better display the distribution.

```{r hist, exercise=TRUE}
gf_histogram( ~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES, bins = 100)
```

## Density plots

A density plot is a smoothed contour tracing the shape of a dataset's
distribution.  The `gf_density()` and `gf_dens()` functions produce these plots
(in slightly different ways).  

```{r, hist-dens, exercise = TRUE}
gf_density( ~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES) 
gf_dens( ~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES) 
```

## Boxplots 

Boxplots are most often used to allow a quick comparison of the distribution of 
a quantitative variable in different groups, as shown here.


```{r, boxplot-groups, exercise=TRUE}
gf_boxplot(TVHrsDay ~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, swap-axes-quiz, echo = FALSE}
question('What happens if you swap the "x" and the "y" in the formula for a boxplot? (Try it and see before answering.)',
         answer('An error. The quantitative variable must always be "y", after the ~.'),
         answer('The coordinates flip (whichever variable is "y" in the formula ends up on the y-axis).', correct = TRUE),
         answer('Nothing. The plot looks the same.'),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```


## Violin Plots

Violin plot construction is very similar to that of boxplots, detailed in the previous section.

```{r, violins, exercise = TRUE}
gf_violin(BPSysAve ~ MaritalStatus, data = NHANES)
```
## Jitter Plots

To "jitter" is to slightly alter the location of points in a graph, so that instead of being overplotted, you can see individual ones more clearly. 

It can be used on its own:

```{r, jitter-alone, exercise = TRUE}
gf_jitter(BPSysAve ~ MaritalStatus, data = NHANES)
```

But more frequently is used as a layer in combination with boxplots or violin plots. We use a pipe (`%>%`) to add the jitter layer:

```{r, jitter-layer, exercise = TRUE}
gf_violin(BPSysAve ~ MaritalStatus, data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_jitter()
```

```{r jitter-violin-quiz, echo = FALSE}
question('What do you think might help the (awful) preceding violin/jitter plot to be more informative?',
         answer('Jitter plots often work better with smaller datasets, so maybe adding the jitter plot just is not ideal for the data', correct = TRUE),
         answer('Making the jittered points semi-transparent', correct = TRUE),
         answer('Changing the color of the jittered points so they fade into the background a bit', correct = TRUE),
         answer('Adjusting the width of the jittered point-column', correct = TRUE),
         answer('Making the dots in the jitter plot larger and adding color and shape by MaritalStatus', message = 'Adding all that color and shape would probably be too busy and add distraction.'),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### Making the fixes

```{r, fixed-jitter, exercise = TRUE}
gf_violin(BPSysAve ~ MaritalStatus, data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_jitter(color = 'grey', alpha = 0.1, width= 0.15)
```

### Boxplots without Outliers

If you add a jitter plot on a boxplot, any outliers get plotted *twice*: once in the boxplot layer and once in the jitter layer. Not good.  You can remove them from the boxplot in this case by setting `outlier.shape = NA`.

Try running the example code, then adjust the jitter plot as you think is needed (`color`, transparency `alpha`, `width`).

```{r, boxplot-no-outliers, exercise = TRUE}
gf_boxplot(faculty_type ~ percentage, data = university_teachers, 
           outlier.shape = NA) %>%
  gf_jitter()
```


## Ordering Groups by Median 
When plotting boxplots or violinplots (etc.), R's default is to order the levels of the categorical variable in *alphabetical order*. Alphabetical is rarely the order you want. More often, you should order by median (or mean) value, or by some intrinsic order.

Take the boxplots from the last example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_boxplot(faculty_type ~ percentage, data = university_teachers)
```

The alphabetical order is nonsense. We can sort the categories by median percentage using the function `fct_reorder()` from the `forcats` package. 

```{r, teachers-by-median, exercise = TRUE}
gf_boxplot(fct_reorder(faculty_type, percentage) ~ percentage, data = university_teachers)
```

The first input to `fct_reorder()` is the categorical variable containing the groups; the second is the quantitative variable whose median you want to order by.

If you want to use some other function of the second variable, say `mean()` instead of median, you add the input `.fun`:

```{r, boxplot-by-mean, exercise = TRUE}
gf_boxplot(fct_reorder(faculty_type, percentage) ~ percentage, 
           .fun = mean,
           data = university_teachers)
```

(Which ends up looking the same, in this particular case.) 

## Ordering Groups Manually
In some cases, you may want to use some human-meaningful ordering of groups. For example, we might order the teacher titles from least to most senior: Grad students, the part-time employees, then Full-time non-tenure-track, then Full-time tenure-track, then Full-time tenured. There is no easy way to tell R the required order other than just listing it out. The function to carry out the re-ordering is `fct_relevel()`.

Since the code to reorganize the levels is a bit long to do *inside* the plotting call, and since we usually want the *same* ordering every time we use such a variable, we modify the variable in the dataset before plotting.

Add the missing levels to the code below, then run it.

```{r, manual-order-boxplots, exercise = TRUE}
university_teachers <- university_teachers %>%
  mutate(faculty_type = fct_relevel(faculty_type,
                                    "Graduate Student Employees",
                                    "Part-Time Faculty",
                                    "Full-Time Non-Tenure-Track Faculty",
                                    ...)
  )
 gf_boxplot(faculty_type ~  percentage, 
           data = university_teachers)
```

```{r, manual-order-boxplots-solution}
university_teachers <- university_teachers %>%
  mutate(faculty_type = fct_relevel(faculty_type,
                                    "Graduate Student Employees",
                                    "Part-Time Faculty",
                                    "Full-Time Non-Tenure-Track Faculty",
                                    "Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty",
                                    "Full-Time Tenured Faculty")
         )
 gf_boxplot(faculty_type ~  percentage, 
           data = university_teachers)
```


## Ordering Groups by Frequency
Finally, we might order groups by the number of observations in each group (frequency). To do this, we use function `fct_infreq()`. Add a jitter plot to the violins to verify the re-ordering:

```{r, order-in-freq, exercise = TRUE}
gf_violin(BPSysAve ~ fct_infreq(MaritalStatus), data = NHANES) 
```

```{r, order-in-freq-solution}
gf_violin(BPSysAve ~ fct_infreq(MaritalStatus), data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_jitter(color = 'grey', alpha = 0.1, width= 0.15)
```

(NA (missing) stays at the end, even if it's commonly observed.)

## Scatter Plot

A simple scatter plot is created with `gf_point()` and has a formula like `y ~ x`.

```{r, simple-scatter, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

## Point/Line Size

To control the size of points and lines in scatter and line charts, use input `size`. It has a relative numeric value -- larger than 1 means larger than the default.

Try adjusting the size of the points in the plot below.  You might want them bigger or smaller depending on the point you are trying to make.

```{r, scatter-size, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, 
         size = 4,
         data = Births1978)
```


## Bubble Chart

A bubble chart is a scatter plot where the *size* of the points is controlled by some third variable. This can be useful when the "dots" represent items that should be visually weighted differently - for example, one point per country (where countries have different population sizes) or one point per class (with different class sizes).

We use the input `size = ~x` where `x` is the name of the variable that will control the point size.

Note that our example datasets don't have any great examples of when this is *useful* -- in the example below the bubble chart may not be necessary.

```{r, bubble-overplot, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(HomeRooms ~ Poverty, 
         size = ~Age,
         data = NHANES)
```

Why is this ineffective? One big reason is that the dataset is so big that the points overlap - making some of them bigger just makes it worse. Just so you can see a bubble chart, let's redo the plot with a subsample of the data. **There is not usually any reason to do this with real data  - you need to find a way to show it all!**

```{r, bubble, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(HomeRooms ~ Poverty, 
         size = ~Age,
         data = mosaic::sample(NHANES, size = 100))
```


## Line Plot

To plot a line instead of dots, simply use `gf_line()` instead of `gf_point()`.  If you want the dots connected *in the order of the rows of the dataset* instead of in ascending x, you can replace `gf_line()` with `gf_path()`.

```{r, line-graph, exercise = TRUE}
gf_line(births ~ date, data = Births1978)

```

## Multiple layers with %>%

A single plot may have multiple layers. For example, you might want a scatter plot with a trend line overlaid on it, or a histogram with a standard normal curve overlaid.

To create a multi-layered plot, simply append `%>%` at the end of the code for one layer and follow that with
another layer. *(The `%>%` symbol is called a "pipe" because it sends the results of one operation on to the next operation for further processing. We often read `%>%` as "and then...")*

### Exercise

1. If you run the following code as is, you will get two separate plots.
2. Combine these two layers into a single plot by appending `%>%` at
the end of the first line.
3. Try adding another layer for a third variable.


```{r multi-layers, exercise = TRUE}
gf_density(~ BPSysAve, data = NHANES)
gf_density(~ BPDiaAve, data = NHANES, fill = "blue")
```

## Adding Lines
There are three helper functions to help add lines to `gf_` graphics:

- `gf_vline(xintercept = ___)` (vertical line)
- `gf_hline(yintercept = ___)` (horizontal line)
- `gf_abline(slope = ___, intercept = ___)` (straight line)

For example, add a line at x = 4, one at y = 2, and one at y = x (just as a demonstration - there is not a very good reason to add the x - 4 and y = 2 reference lines to *this* plot...)

```{r, ref-lines, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(nBabies ~ nPregnancies, data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 4) %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept = 2) %>%
  gf_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

## Simple Linear Regression Line

We can add a (simple) linear regression line to a scatter plot using the function `gf_lm()`. 

For example, we might investigate whether there is a linear relationship between total cholesterol and weight using the NHANES data:

```{r, lm-example, exercise=TRUE}
gf_point(TotChol ~ Weight, data = NHANES, alpha = 0.1) %>%
  gf_lm()
```


## Bar graphs

Bar graphs help visualize the distribution of a **categorical** variable, 
and we can create them with `gf_bar()`. 

```{r, bar-graphs, exercise=TRUE}
gf_bar( ~ TVHrsDay, data = NHANES)
```

### Percents and Proportions?
What if we want to show the percent or proportion in each category, rather than the number of observations? `gf_percents()` and `gf_props()` to the rescue! Try changing the function from `gf_bar()` to `gf_percents()` or `gf_props()` and see what happens.

You can also add an 'h' at the end of each function to make the plots 'horizontal' with `gf_barh()`, `gf_propsh()`, and `gf_percentsh()`. Try that too!


```{r, prop-graphs, exercise=TRUE}
gf_bar( ~ TVHrsDay, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, prop-graphs-hint-1}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, prop-graphs-hint-2}
gf_percents( ~ TVHrsDay, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, prop-graphs-hint-3}
gf_percentsh( ~ TVHrsDay, data = NHANES)
```


## Stacked bar graphs

What if, instead of one figure panel per group, you want to see a stacked bar
graph for the same data?  Here's an example.  You use the input: 

`fill= ~ variable_name` 

to specify the name of the variable that defines the groups (here, `Marijuana`).

Try to see what happens if you use `gf_props()` or `gf_percents()`, or one of their `h` (horizontal) variants.

```{r, stacked-bar, exercise = TRUE}
gf_bar( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, stacked-bar, hint-1}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, stacked-bar, hint-2}
gf_propsh( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES)
```

```{r denom-quiz, echo = FALSE}
question('When showing a stacked bar graph with proportions, what is the default DENOMINATOR used to computing the proportions? Use the graph you just made to figure it out.',
         answer('The total number of observations in the dataset (so all the parts of all the bars together sum to 1)', 
                correct = TRUE),
         answer('The number of observations in the stack (so the parts of one bar together sum to 1)'),
         answer('The number of observations in the "fill" variable group (so all bar-parts of the same color sum to 1)'),
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## Changing the Denominator

You can control the denominator used to compute bar graph proportions with the input `denom`. Its value should be a one-sided function of the form `~ x` giving the *role in the plot* of the variable defining the groups to use as the denominator. In our `gf_props()` plot
above, we might pick `x`, so that the total proportion in each T.V. hours group sums to 1. Give it a try:

```{r, change-denom, exercise = TRUE}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES)
```

```{r, change-denom-hint-1}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES,
          denom = ...)
```

```{r, change-denom-hint-2}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES,
          denom = ~...)
```

```{r, change-denom-hint-3}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES,
          denom = ~ x)
```

This works generally. A shortcut in the stacked-bar-graph case is to use the input `position = "fill"` instead of `denom`:

```{r, position-fill, exercise = TRUE}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, fill = ~ Marijuana, 
          data = NHANES, 
          position = 'fill')
```

## Side-by-Side bar graphs

What if, instead of stacked bars, you want side-by-side bars? 
Simply add the additional argument

  * `position='dodge'`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gf_bar( ~ TVHrsDay, 
        fill = ~ Marijuana,
        data = NHANES, 
        position = 'dodge')
```

Note that if you want to change the denominator, you can use `position = 'dodge'` *and* `denom = ~x` together, but you can't have `position` be both "stack" and "fill".

```{r}
gf_props( ~ TVHrsDay, 
        fill = ~ Marijuana,
        data = NHANES, 
        position = 'dodge',
        denom = ~ x)
```
## Pie Chart

Making nice pie charts in R is a bit of work, because most of the plotting libraries are not set up to do it well...you have to force them to do your will.  Don't say you weren't warned!  But, with a little effort, you can make decent pie charts.

A pie chart usually doesn't have any background elements like axis labels or gridlines. To make one, we make a bar graph with `gf_bar()`, put it in polar coordinates, and ensure we are using a plot template with no background elements via `theme_set(theme_void())`.

Strangely enough, we want to start with a stacked bar chart *colored by* our variable of interest. We include 1 rather than a variable name in the formula (because we want just one stacked bar), and we add the input `width=1` because we want the single bar to take up the whole width of the graph. And we swap the y-axis into polar coordinates (try removing the `gf_refine()` line to see how it look before pie-ification).

```{r pie, exercise = TRUE}
theme_set(theme_void())
gf_bar(~1, fill = ~Diabetes, data = NHANES,
       width = 1) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_polar('y'))
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Bar graph, pre-tabulated

Sometimes, you may be given data that is already tabulated. Instead of a dataset with one row for every case, you will have one row for every group, and a variable that gives the number of observations in each group.  The `university_teachers` dataset is an example, with one row for each combination of job title and year.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
DT::datatable(university_teachers)
```

We can use the function `gf_col` to make a bar graph of pre-tabulated data.
This function always expects the counts (or proportions or percentages) as the `y` part of the formula, and the
group names as `x` (after the tilde).

```{r col-plot, exercise=TRUE}
gf_col(percentage ~ faculty_type, 
       data = university_teachers)
```

This plot illustrates a common issue -- category labels that overlap and become illegible.  What can we do to fix it?

## Axis Labels that Don't Fit
Sometimes - particularly for bar graphs of categorical variables with long category names - axis tick labels overlap in an ugly way. For example:

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=4}
gf_bar(~Education, data=NHANES)
```

### Flip the Axes
One simple way to solve this problem is to flip the x and y axes of the plot.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gf_bar(~Education, data=NHANES) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip())
```

### Rotate the Labels
Another solution is to rotate the axis labels. We can do that by modifying the `angle` and `hjust` values for the x tick labels in the plot's `theme`.  `angle` is the angle in degrees by which to rotate the labels, and `hjust` moves them up and down (positive `hjust` moves down, and negative moves up). For example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gf_bar(~Education, data = NHANES) %>% 
    gf_theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1))
```

### Your Turn!
The dataset at <http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv> provides data on mammal metabolic rates.  Read it in and make a bar graph of the number of observations per Order (or per Family, Genus, or Species) with legible axis tick labels.

```{r mmr, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mmr-hint-1}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
```

```{r mmr-hint-2}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(_____, data = _____)
```

```{r mmr-hint-3}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(_____, data = mmr)
```


```{r mmr-hint-4}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(~ ____, data = mmr)
```

```{r mmr-hint-5}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(~ Order, data = mmr)
```

```{r mmr-hint-6}
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(~ Order, data = mmr) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip())
# note: other solutions are possible.
```

```{r mmr-hint-7}
# to be extra: adjust the order of groups
mmr <- read_csv('http://sldr.netlify.app/data/MammalMetabolicRates.csv')
gf_bar(~ fct_infreq(Order), data = mmr) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_flip())
# note: other solutions are possible.
```

## Tabulating Data

To make a Cleveland dot-plot or lollipop plot, you need to switch from a dataset with one row per *observation* to one row per *group* that you want to plot.  We will learn more about this kind of data wrangling later. 

Here, we want to `group_by()` the variable that defines the groups, and then `summarize()` within each group by computing the number of observations `n()` or the proportion or percentage of interest. Finally, always `ungroup()` at the end. Let's try it with the `mmr` data.

```{r, to-summary, exercise = TRUE}
mmr_tab <- mmr %>%
  group_by(Order) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            prop = n() / nrow(mmr),
            perc = prop / 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Cleveland Dotplot
*Note: this requires tabulated data.*

With tabulated data, a Cleveland dot plot is just a scatter plot. But we need to order `n` -- give it a try!

```{r, cleveland-dot, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(Order ~ n, data = mmr_tab)
```

```{r cleveland-dot-hint-1}
gf_point(fct_reorder(___, ___) ~ n, data = mmr_tab)
```

```{r cleveland-dot-hint-2}
gf_point(fct_reorder(Order, n) ~ n, data = mmr_tab)
```

## Lollipop Plot
This is just a Cleveland dot plot plus "sticks"; we use `gf_segment()` to add the sticks. The formula for `gf_segment()` has the form: `y + yend ~ x + xend.`.

```{r, lollipop, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(fct_reorder(Order, n) ~ n, data = mmr_tab) %>%
  gf_segment(Order + Order ~ 0 + n, data = mmr_tab)
```



## Facets (Multi-panel plots)

If we want to look at all 20 years of birth data, overlaying the data is likely
to put too much information in too little space and make it hard to tell which
data is from which year.  (Even with good color and symbol choices, deciphering
20 colors or 20 shapes is hard.) Instead, we can put each year in separate
**facet** or sub-plot.  By default the coordinate systems will be shared across
the facets which can make comparisons across facets easier.

There are two ways to create facets.  The simplest way is to add a vertical bar `|` to
our formula.


```{r, births-facets, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year, data = Births, size = 0.5)
```

The second way is to add on a facet command using `%>%`:

```{r, births-facets-wrap, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births, size = 0.5) %>%
gf_facet_wrap( ~ year)
```

#### Practice with facets

Edit the plot below to:

1. make one facet for each day of the week (`wday`)
2. map color to `year`

```{r, births-facets-ex1, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births, 
         size = 0.5, color = "blue")
```

```{r births-facets-ex1-hint}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | wday, data = Births, 
         size = 0.5, color = ~ year)
```

## Facet Grids

Create a multi-panel plot that uses rows, or columns, or both in a fixed way. For example, you want to show a scatter plot of data for each of three years (three rows of facets) and four seasons (four columns of facets).

To do this, add *another formula* after the `|` in the formula input, as done below. Can you figure out what the formula does?  If you need a hint, try changing `year ~ wday` to `wday ~ year` and see what happens... 

```{r, facet-grid, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year ~ wday, data = Births, size = 0.5)
```

### The Facet Grid Formula 

Hopefully, you figured out that the facet grid formula (the one to the right of the `|`) is interpreted as "row
variable ~ column variable" -- the resulting plot will have one row of facets
for every value of the first variable, and one column of facets for every value
of the second variable.

### Practice with the facet grid formula

Recreate the plot below using `gf_facet_grid()`.  This works much like
`gf_facet_wrap()` and accepts a formula with one of three shapes:

* `y ~ x` (facets along both axes)
* ` ~ x`  (facets only along x-axis)
* `y ~ .` (facets only along y-axis; notice the important dot in this one)  

(These three formula shapes can also be used on the right side of `|`.)


```{r, facet-grid2, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}
gf_bar( ~ TVHrsDay | Marijuana ~ Gender, fill = ~ Marijuana, data = NHANES)
```




## Color: One custom choice
We can manually set the color of the main element of a simple plot (like the line in `gf_line()`, or the points in `gf_point()`) using the `...` part of our template.

&nbsp;
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h3></center>
&nbsp;

The general form for things in `...` is `attribute = value`.

For example, 

* `color = "red"` or `fill = "navy"` (note quotes) can be used to change the
colors of things.  

* (`fill` is typically used for regions that are "filled in"
and `color` for dots and lines.)

After running the code below, find the name of an R color at [datanovia](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/awesome-list-of-657-r-color-names/) and change the points in the scatterplot to be that color.

```{r, gf-options-1, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, 
         color = "navy")
```


## Color: by variable values 

Often, rather than manually setting all elements to be one color, we want to *map* color to some variable (so that each value of that variable corresponds to a distinct color).

To do it, we provide the input `color = ~variable` to our plotting function.
*  `color = ~wday` **maps** color to the day of the week `wday`. 

For example, to map color to `wday` in a time-series plot of 1978 births: 

```{r, color-mapping, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = ~wday)
```

This works for continuous variables, too, but the color scale used will be continuous instead of distinct discrete colors that are easy to tell apart. Try mapping color to `day_of_year` in the same time-series plot as above.

```{r, color-map-contin, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r, color-map-contin-hint-1}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, ...)
```


```{r, color-map-contin-hint-2}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = _______)
```

```{r, color-map-contin-hint-3}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = ~day_of_year)
```

```{r color-mapping-quiz}
quiz(
question(
"Does it appear that the number of births is different on weekends and weekdays?",
answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
answer("no")
),
question(
"What actually happens if you omit the `~` before `~ wday`?  (Try it and see.)",
answer("It works just the same.  The tilde isn't required."),
answer("All the dots are the same color."),
answer("There is an error message: 'wday' not found.", correct = TRUE)
)
)
```

## Change Color Palette

We can use `gf_theme(scale_---_---( ))`.

The first `---` is often either `color` or `fill`, to choose a color palette for the color or fill in the plot. (`scale_fill_---()` or `scale_color_---()`).

The second `---` is the name of the type of color palette to use. There are lots of options -- type `?scale_color_` and let autofill show you all the choices!

A good set of palettes to begin with is the `RColorBrewer` palettes:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6}
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

The middle group works better for categorical scales.

To choose one, note its name on the left. Then call (for example) `scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Dark2')`. You can add `direction = -1` to reverse the order.

Try the plot below, then test some other palette options (try reversing the order, too). Which do you prefer?

```{r, brewer-pal-test, exercise = TRUE}
gf_percents(~AgeDecade, 
            fill = ~Race1, 
            denom = ~x,
            data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_theme(scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1'))
```

## Color one group
Sometimes you may wish to highlight the data for one particular group by greying out all other data. An easy way to do this is to create a variable that "keeps" only the group you want with `fct_other()`, then use `gf_theme(scale_color_manual())` to set a manual color palette with two colors (grey and the other one you want).

What if we want to highlight the proportion of teachers who are grad students? We make a new variable `grad_stud` that tells whether the faculty type is "Grad Student" or not, and color by it. We still `group` by `faculty_type` so that we get only one line per faculty type (try removing this to see the problem that happens).

```{r, one-color-highlight, exercise = TRUE}
university_teachers <- university_teachers %>%
  mutate(grad_stud = fct_other(faculty_type, 
                               keep = 'Graduate Student Employees'))

gf_path(percentage ~ year, data = university_teachers,
        color = ~grad_stud,
        group = ~faculty_type) %>%
  gf_theme(scale_color_manual(values = c('hotpink', 'grey')))
```



## Axis labels

One of the most common customizations you will want to make to your plots will
be to change the title, subtitle, and axis labels (and maybe add a caption).
All these things can be done by chaining (`%>%`) the function `gf_labs()` with a
plot layer.

Check out the example below, and try changing the text labels to ones that make
sense to you. Note that all the input arguments to `gf_labs` are optional. So,
for example, you could alter *only* the x-axis label by chaining the command
`gf_labs(x = 'My X Axis Label')` with your plot.

```{r gf-labs-example, exercise=TRUE}
gf_bar(~Race1, data=NHANES) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Race in NHANES Data",
    subtitle = "(2009-2012)",
    caption = "These data were collected by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which has conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys since the early 1960's.",
    x = "",  # empty quotes here results in no x-axis label!
    y = "Number of Observations"
  )
```

## Axis limits

You can also `gf_lims()` to set custom x and y axis limits. 

How does adjusting the axis limits alter your interpretation of the plot?

```{r axis-limits, exercise=TRUE}
gf_line(births ~ date, data = Births1978) %>%
  gf_lims(y = c(0, 14000))
```

```{r axis-limits-2, exercise=TRUE}
gf_boxplot(faculty_type ~ percentage, data = university_teachers) %>%
  gf_lims(x = c(0, 50))
```

## Grid Lines

Grid lines can be controlled using `gf_theme()` with inputs

- `panel.grid`
- `panel.grid.major`
- `panel.grid.minor`
- `panel.grid.major.x`
- `panel.grid.major.y`
- `panel.grid.minor.x`
- `panel.grid.minor.y`

If you don't specify `x` or `y` or `major` or `minor`, your options apply to all.

Setting any of these to `element_blank()` removes them.  Try a few different grid options. How can you remove the minor gridlines and the vertical gridlines?

```{r control-grids, exercise = TRUE}
gf_path(percentage ~ year, color = ~faculty_type,
        data = university_teachers) %>%
  gf_theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

```{r control-grids-hint-1}
gf_path(percentage ~ year, color = ~faculty_type,
        data = university_teachers) %>%
  gf_theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
           panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())
```

## Custom Legend Title
Sometimes you might want to remove the legend title, or replace it with a more readable one.  You can do it with `gf_theme()`. Try the plot below with and without the `gf_theme()` line to see how it changes. Replace `"Activity"` with `""` (empty quotes) to remove the legend title entirely.

```{r custom-legend-title, exercise = TRUE}
gf_bar(~AgeDecade, fill = ~PhysActive, 
       position = 'stack', 
       data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_theme(scale_fill_discrete('Activity'))
```

## (Re)Move Legend
To remove the legend entirely (make sure you really want to do this!) you chain from your plot layer to `gf_theme()` with input `legend.position = 'none'`.

```{r bye-legend, exercise = TRUE}
gf_bar(~AgeDecade, fill = ~PhysActive, 
       position = 'stack', 
       data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

To change its location, set `legend.position` to `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`.

```{r top-legend, exercise = TRUE}
gf_bar(~AgeDecade, fill = ~PhysActive, 
       position = 'stack', 
       data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_theme(legend.position = 'top')
```

## Adjust Figure Size
You will almost certainly want to adjust figure sizes in your own RMarkdown documents. There are several ways - you can set a file-wide default in the header of the Rmd file as is done in your homework template - or you can set the figure size for one R code chunk in the chunk header, as shown below.

The values of `fig.width` and `fig.height` are expected to be given in inches, by default.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 0.7}
knitr::include_graphics('https://sldr.netlify.app/data/fig-size.png')
```


## More?

Whew! That was a lot. But it still doesn't cover every graphics question you might have. Were there parts that seemed disposable to you, and could be removed? Or, are there other things you really want examples of?

```{r reflection, echo = FALSE}
question('What parts seemed too long or unnecessary? Or, what would you like to see added to this reference guide? How would you reorganize topics?',
         type = 'learnr_text',
         answer('   ', correct = TRUE),
         try_again = 'Edit your answer',
         incorrect = 'Thank you for your submission.')
